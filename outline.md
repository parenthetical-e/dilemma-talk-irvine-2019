- What are we talking about?
- Why: R is basic.
- Exploration is the problem
- Why do animals explore?
- We know that reward won't get us there. Avg is best we can. 
- No one wants a life of regret... G
- What about the other cases.
- Curiosity? E.
- An assertion or conjecture:
-   E is basic
-   You have to learn about your niche
-   Curiosity is not a luxury

- But, Much smaller. 
- Hard to formalize. 
- Hodge podge of attempts. Heuristics or prescriptions.

- We need a RL of curiosity. 
- - An agreed set of objectives and methods.
- - Still a value problem
- To be be (usefully) curious you need a memory
- - Memories: remember and forget
- - Value is how far a memory moves? 
- M: {Real}, distance is a norm
- Ax 1!
- Ax 2!
- Bellman!
- Ta-da!

- Reward is fundamental
- Information is fundamental.
- Information <> Reward
- Basic reward examples.
- Dynamics

- Dual objectives
- Dual value learning
- Optimal in the following senses
- No regret
- Hidden limits

- Any RL; Any M
- Some examples

- Strictly deterministic
- Efficient in AI
- Great for animals; perfect predict is at least in principle possible.

- Summary:
- Don't explore to get a reward.
- Explore to learn, and the reward will come.
